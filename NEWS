HOLOVID RELEASE ALPHA 01
Breaking News

Authorities report that a Gencore special task force, working from a secret 
lab at Deliani, are engaged in a project to reimplement the historically 
significant "videogame" entitled ~Tyrian~, a work regarded by historians as 
a cultural artifact of utmost importance, and by the Church of Zinglon as a 
holy prophecy. News of this effort have caused uproar through the galaxy, 
but Gencore remains silent on the matter and officially-released details are 
sparse. When approached for comment, Gencore Chancellor Transon Lohk 
replied, "Who are you and what are you doing in my house? Get out!"

Stay tuned for updates to this galaxy-shaking event!
